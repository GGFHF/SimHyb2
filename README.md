# SimHyb2
SIMHYB 2 is a Java-based software for the simulation of mixed hybridizing populations. The program is intended for the analysis of the effect of the different demographic, adaptive and reproductive factors on the evolution of these populations. Census size of each species, immigrants, number of intermediate specific classes, directional fertility among them and fitness coefficient of each class can be defined by the user. Inheritance of fitness and ageing effect are also taken into account. The software generates individuals of known pedigree, allowing their traceability throughout the generations. SIMHYB 2 output files are easily convertible into inputs for GENALEX (Peakall & Smouse, 2012) or STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al., 2000), some of the most popular software for population genetics and Bayesian analysis.

Initially, SIMHYB 2 was intended for hermaphrodite long-living plants, such as trees (so it considers features such as the presence of chloroplast, overlapping generations or the possibility of self-incompatibility processes), but it can be also applied for other organisms, taking into account certain considerations.

To run SIMHYB2 simply download and decompress the “simhyb2.rar” file. It includes the executable “simhyb2.jar”, the file “simhyb.properties” and an empty folder named “logs”, as well as the user manual and input examples. Be sure you have Java16 (or a later version) installed in your OS. The logs folder, the file simhyb.properties and the executable simhyb2.jar must be located in the same path in your computer. No further installation is required, just execute simhyb2.jar and the simulation interface will open.
SIMHYB 2 can also be executed from the command line: move to the folder where simhyb2.jar, simhyb.properties, and the logs folder are located and just execute the command java –jar “simhyb2.jar”

Refer to the SIMHYB 2 manual (https://github.com/GGFHF/SimHyb2/blob/main/Package/SimHyb2%20User%20Manual.pdf) for installation instructions, a description of the software and examples of use. Also, you can see the paper:
